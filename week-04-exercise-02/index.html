        <h1>My 2022 Philippines Travel Pictures</h1>
        <p>
            I have traveled to the Philippines many times over the past decade, but my 2022 trip was the most memorable. 
            I have gathered some of my favorite photos from that journey. This collection not only highlights my most 
            cherished memories but also demonstrates how responsive design makes it easy to share them seamlessly 
            across any screen size.

                <p class="description">
                    Just a normal everyday scene in the Philippines. What I love about this picture is how it captures 
                    many authentic modes of transportation, including jeepneys (mini-buses), tricycles (motorcycles with 
                    sidecars for passengers), motorcycles, and pedicabs (similar to tricycles but powered by human effort 
                    instead of a motorcycle).

                <h2>General MacArthur Statue</h2>
                <p class="details">Philippines | 2022</p>
                <p class="description">
                    Being a huge WWII history enthusiast, seeing Gen. MacArthur's statue on the island of Leyte was breathtaking. 
                    MacArthur was a famous American general who, after the Japanese drove the Americans out of the Philippines, 
                    declared to the Filipino people the famous words: <b>"I shall return"</b> and he did. 
                    This statue depicts his historic walk upon returning (third from the left).

                <h2>Bangka Boat</h2>
                <p class="details">Philippines | 2022</p>
                <p class="description">
                    While island-hopping, I came across many bangka boats, including the one I photographed. 
                    A traditional wooden bangka is narrow and canoe like, with long bamboo poles extending from 
                    each side called outriggers, that provide balance and stability on the water. 
                    Most are fitted with an outboard motor, giving them extra speed and range, which makes them ideal 
                    for island-hopping or short coastal trips.

                <img src="./Photo-4-Island.JPG" alt="Laoang Island" />
                <h2>Laoang Island</h2>
                <p class="details">Philippines | 2022</p>
                <p class="description">
                    This picture was taken from my in-laws house on Laoang Island, located just north of Northern Samar. 
                    The island has a small population and not very large in size, but its charm is undeniable. 
                    What I love most about this photo is the quiet tranquility at sunset, the silhouettes of palm trees, 
                    the stillness of the water, and the peaceful rhythm of coastal village life. The roof huts and simple 
                    pathways provides a deep sense of simplicity and connection to nature.

                <p class="details">Philippines | 2022</p>
                <p class="description">
                    This picture was taken from my wife's aunt and uncle's house, overlooking their backyard in the 
                    northern province of Isabela on Luzon Island. It's about an eight-hour drive northeast of Manila. 
                    Fun fact: this region is known as the corn capital of the Philippines.

                <p class="details">Philippines | 2022</p>
                <p class="description">
                    This picture was taken from my in-laws house during my father-in-laws birthday celebration. 
                    It features a roasted pig known as lechon. This is a common item found at most Filipino festivities 
                    like birthdays,weddings, and holidays. It is cooked over charcoal for several hours and has a crispy 
                    golden skin and tender, flavorful meat. It is often laid out on banana leaves and carved right at the table.
