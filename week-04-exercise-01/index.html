        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism: Gmail Logo</h1>
        <p>
            I used the dev tool to modify the Gmail website logo. I edited the word "Gmail" in the header to change its appearance. 
            These edits only appeared locally on my computer and did not affect the actual website.

        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
